# 💼 Portfolio Repository - emikes97

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of my personal Python Projects, built as part of my journey to learn Python and become better at software development!
Each Project focuses on clean code (Well... mostly! Still refactoring a few spaghetti segments!), modular design and mostly practical use cases.
